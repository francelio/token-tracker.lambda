## Description 
-----------------------------
Token Tracker lets you keep track of your game's players, their score, who's winning, and more. With Token Tracker you can add players to your game by assigning them a color token. Just have your players pick a color, add them to your game, and start playing. Keeping score is as easy as asking Token Tracker to add or subtract points for a color token. You can also ask Token Tracker to tell you who's winning, who has the lowest score, and what's the average score among all tokens. Asking Token Tracker to reset everyone's score is all it takes to start a new game from scratch. Here's a quick look at the features you'll get with Token Tracker:

- Multiple token colors to choose
- Tracking for each token's score
- Add and remove points for each token
- High-score announcement
- Low-score announcement
- The average score for the current game
- Add and remove points from all tokens at once
- Announce all tokens and their current score
